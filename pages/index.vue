              We use platforms like Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to share trivial details of our day-to-day lives and  exchange serious information, resources and calls-to-action about important things going on across the world — from COVID-19 to Black Lives Matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              But whenever hashtags start to trend, things also get complicated. How have efforts like #blackouttuesday impacted the movement for Black lives, in productive or harmful ways? To answer that question, we’re taking a look at five moments produced by social media that shine a light on the best and worst of these platforms as solidarity tools.

                  Blackout Tuesday, initially dubbed <a target="_blank" class="link green dim underline" href="https://www.theshowmustbepaused.com/about">#TheShowMustBePaused by Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang</a>, was a way to memorialize the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The idea, which <a target="_blank" class="link green dim underline" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/arts/music/what-blackout-tuesday.html">originated in the music industry</a>, soon caught on, and people across social media started posting black squares as a sign of solidarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The only problem? Because people were adding #blacklivesmatter to those posts, social media algorithms boosted images of black squares instead of important information related to Black Lives Matter organizing.

                  In response to Blackout Tuesday, white supremacists decided to create their own event and hashtag, #whiteoutwednesday, to advance their racist agenda. However, <a target="_blank" class="link green dim underline" href="https://yr.media/arts-culture/k-pop-fans-get-creative-to-thwart-online-trolls/">K-pop fans</a> caught on and decided to flood the hashtag with videos of their favorite stars. Soon, K-pop videos were all you could see when you searched #whiteoutwednesday or #whitelivesmatter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This isn’t the first time K-pop fans have done this kind of thing. When the <a target="_blank" class="link green dim underline" href="https://twitter.com/DallasPD/status/1266969685532332032">Dallas Police department</a> tried using a video app to identify protesters, K-pop fans <a target="_blank" class="link green dim underline" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277423/k-pop-dallas-pd-iwatch-app-flood-review-bomb-surveillance-protests-george-floyd">flooded the app</a> with videos of their top stars and crashed the app. More recently, K-pop stans, along with TikTok users, have taken some credit for <a target="_blank" class="link green dim underline" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html">Trump’s underwhelming Tulsa rally on June 20th</a> — reporting that they registered thousands of tickets and then didn’t show up, creating a prime photo op: rows of empty seats.

                  TikTok was accused of preventing people from seeing posts with the hashtags #blacklivesmatter and #GeorgeFloyd.

                <p>
                  Users <a target="_blank" class="link green dim underline" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-tiktok/fact-check-the-blacklivesmatter-hashtag-is-not-banned-on-tiktok-idUSKBN2360OT">reported</a> that when they searched for the terms “blacklivesmatter” and “GeorgeFloyd,” there were 0 views — sparking speculation that TikTok had censored those phrases. TikTok responded with a statement that the problem had been a glitch that also affected terms like #cat and #hello. Still, glitch or not, the issue has been resolved, and when you search for those same terms on TikTok now, you should get a full view count.

                  Those conversations can be powerful and go a long way to highlighting everyday racism, but remember — “allies” highlighting what’s hard about this moment for them personally — can do real damage.

              In the days of perpetual quarantine when we can’t connect as easily off-line, social media is more important than ever. But if we’re going to depend this heavily on these platforms, we have to use them to impact real change. We can’t just post black squares on Instagram and say we’re done, nor can we pick up a drill just to make it look like we’re doing something. We actually have to do it.

                Protest. Get your mask, make some signs, and get out of the house! Make your voice heard. Unable to make it out to protests? Call your elected officials and let them know you stand with the Black Lives Matter movement.
              </li>
              <li>Stay informed. Knowledge is also power, and you can take this opportunity to learn more. Read a book or watch a documentary on the systemic racism of our country. Understand just what we’re facing and what we need to do to fix the problem.</li>
              <li class="pv3 bb bt b--white-20">
                Need to get some things off your chest? Talk openly to others about the Black Lives Matter movement and police brutality — whether it’s someone who agrees with you or someone who might not. If you're lucky, you might even change someone’s mind!

              <li class="pv3 bb bt b--white-20">
                Keep posting, and each time you post, think about what you want to accomplish and pay attention to responses, so you can keep learning about the best ways to be a part of positive change.

            </ol>
            <p>
              Social media can — and has — sparked real-world change, but that change doesn't happen on its own. So keep fighting!
